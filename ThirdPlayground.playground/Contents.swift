// so basically what stride does is its skips few elements that we want to be skipped
// so in the below example we wanted to go from 0 to 256 but by 16 numbers
// also in stride "through" we include the last value but in stride "to" we dont include the last value
// we also go in decrement order in stride but not with range operator
// therefore stride can include negative values too
